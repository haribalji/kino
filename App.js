          },
          Title3:"Our Solution",
          Title3content:"Kinocil addresses these challenges by eliminating the need for permanent structures or mooring, thereby reducing costs and enhancing efficiency. Leveraging Pascal's principle and the self-leveling effect of water, our interconnected fluid-filled cylinders capture the kinetic energy of ocean waves. This energy is then converted into electricity via Wells turbines, which efficiently translate the dynamic linear motion of the fluid within the tanks into usable power."
,
          Title4:"Design Process",
          Title4content:"Our initial goal was to develop a concept that didnâ€™t rely on permanent structures for energy extraction. Drawing inspiration from ancient water leveling devices, we created a prototype using plastic bottles connected by tubes. This early test was promising but revealed that the water flow rate between tanks was too slow. Our calculations showed that using tanks and tubes of the same diameter improved water movement, leading us to construct a new prototype that performed more effectively. We then enhanced the design with floats to serve as a power take-off mechanism, but efficiency remained suboptimal. Further testing in a dry environment showed an efficiency of over 65%, outperforming many existing wave energy systems. In collaboration with industry leaders like Mocean, we identified the Wells turbine as a highly efficient solution for power conversion. We are currently testing the Wells turbine in a mini tank to validate its efficiency before scaling up."
,
Title5:"What Sets Us Apart",
Title5content:"Traditional wave energy converters typically require costly permanent structures or mooring systems. Our design, however, harnesses the relative motion between fluid-filled tanks floating on ocean waves, eliminating the need for such infrastructure and reducing costs significantly. Additionally, our power take-off system is a major differentiator. Unlike other platforms, such as Pelamis, that rely on inefficient hydraulic systems, Kinocil supports a variety of power take-off mechanisms, including the highly efficient Wells turbines. This innovative approach combines cost-effective design with maximum energy conversion efficiency, making Kinocil a scalable and environmentally friendly solution for ocean wave energy."
